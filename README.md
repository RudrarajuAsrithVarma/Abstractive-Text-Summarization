# Abstractive-Text-Summarization

## Introduction

This project aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by providing personalized movie summaries based on the user's viewing history. It utilizes abstractive text summarization, employing the fine-tuned PEGASUS model developed by Google with the IMDB dataset. By considering the user's ten previous movies, the summary for their next movie choice is customized to their preferences, incorporating elements from their past viewing experiences. This personalized approach improves decision-making and ensures the user receives summaries aligned with their interests.

## Designed a User Interface using a Third party website for giving the storyline as input which results in a Concise Summary generated by the model

## We Used a python code to check for similarity between the generated summaries and the results are as follows:-

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the abstractive summarization project aimed to generate concise and meaningful summaries using advanced natural language processing techniques. Through the utilization of models like Pegasus-XSum and leveraging the power of NVIDIA DGX-1 supercomputer, we were able to fine-tune large-scale models that are computationally intensive to run on personal computers. This enabled us to generate abstractive summaries that captured the essence of the original text in a more human-like manner.
